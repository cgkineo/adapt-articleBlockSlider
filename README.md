# adapt-articleBlockSlider

**Article Block Slider** is a Kineo *presentation extension*.

The extension changes the presentation of an article's blocks from being vertically stacked to horizontally ordered. This is achieved by implementing a left and right or tabbing navigational element to the article. By default, the **Article Block Slider** is available on large resolutions only (medium and small resolutions can be added but are currently unsupported). When viewing at other resolutions the blocks return to being vertically stacked.

## Installation

Open the */src/extensions* folder in a new terminal window on Mac OSX or right click the folder and select 'Git Bash Here' on Windows.

Git clone the component, making sure to delete the hidden **.git** folder from the *adapt-articleBlockSlider* folder.

## Settings  

The attributes listed below are used in *articles.json* to configure **Article Block Slider**, and are properly formatted as JSON in [*example.json*](https://github.com/cgkineo/adapt-articleBlockSlider/blob/master/example.json).

**_articleBlockSlider** (object): The Article Block Slider object that contains values for **_isEnabled**, **_isDisabledWhenAccessibilityActive**, **_slideAnimationDuration**, **_heightAnimationDuration**, **_isEnabledOnScreenSizes**, **_hasTabs**, **_hasArrows**, **_startIndex**, **_hasUniformHeight**, and **_minHeight**.

>**_isEnabled** (boolean): Turns Article Block Slider on and off. Acceptable values are `true` and `false`.

>**_isDisabledWhenAccessibilityActive** (boolean): Disables this extension when accessibility is active to simplify navigation for screen reader users. Acceptable values are `true` and `false`.

>**_slideAnimationDuration** (number): Sets the slide duration, in milliseconds, of the animation between blocks.

>**_heightAnimationDuration** (number): Sets the duration, in milliseconds, of the animation between varying blocks' heights.

>**_isEnabledOnScreenSizes** (string): Defines which screen sizes the Article Block Slider displays the navigation elements on. Acceptable values are `"large"`, `"medium"` and `"small"` or combinations thereof as a space-separated list e.g. `"large medium"`.

>**_hasTabs** (boolean): Turns the tab navigation on and off. If `_hasTabs` is set to true, you must set `_hasArrows` to false. Acceptable values are `true` and `false`. 

>**_hasArrows** (boolean): Turns the arrow navigation on and off. If `_hasArrows` is set to true, you must set `_hasTabs` to false. Acceptable values are `true` and `false`. 

>**_startIndex** (number): Sets which block displays on page load.

>**_hasUniformHeight** (boolean): Sets all elements within the Article Block Slider to use the highest blocks height. Acceptable values are `true` and `false`.

>**_minHeight** (number): Sets a minimum height on the `.article-block-slider` container class.

## Limitations
 
Only one navigation element (Arrows or Tabs) should be active at any one time.  

The **Article Block Slider** and **Quicknav** extensions don't interact well together when the **Article Block Slider** is the last article on a page with an enabled **Quicknav.**
